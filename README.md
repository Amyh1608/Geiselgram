This hosts my VIS 145A final project which is a critique of public spaces and how they are transformed over time to due to social media. 

### Project Description:
One of the most iconic landmarks of UCSDâ€™s campus is Geisel library which is located approximately in the middle campus. It is through the representation of Geisel library where I wanted to emulate how a space transforms and transcends its original purpose. A library is commonly a collection of knowledge however, I feel that in near future the library will become fully digitalized where a student or researcher could access archives in the comfort of their office. In addition, the library tends to be a quiet space where one could focus on work in peace. Instead, Geisel library is more commonly a place where students meet up to study and socialize. Sometimes however, students with the intention to study can get distracted through the means of social media and social interactions. Similar to how Geisel was designed like a spaceship that connects many worlds through books, I feel it could also connect our students through its representation on social media. 
 
The composition of the piece is a webpage because I wanted the user to be interacting with something familiar that interfaces with social media sites. The program takes an audio input that responds to noise, the louder an environment is, the more floors of Geisel will fill up from top to bottom. The order is reminiscent of how the top floor is the most quiet and they are louder as you go down. Each floor of Geisel fills with different photos pulled from Instagram with the location tag of Geisel. It builds on the idea of what is the digital identity of Geisel and how visitors interact with the space. It also gives the sense of what a place is like without having to be physically there. The photos from Instagram are pulled from public accounts and each picture posted represents a collection of identities that build the community around Geisel. In addition, a physical public place is where people gather and it's likely that through one's digital footprint, it can be possible to find where someone is physically located at a given time. 

Another part of the interface is that the screen will also fill with Twitter Tweets with the hashtag #Geisel arranged in the colors of the sunset. A sunset tends to be the generic beach photo that compliments ones social media especially on the West Coast. ust like the photos, the text cloud is interacted with based on how loud is picked up from the audio input. The more loud the more the cloud fills the screen with Twitter tweets. It adds to how more noise, in a traditionally quiet space, can be overwhelming preventing the original purpose of the space to occur. A fun point to note is that the word "Geisel" (although the surname of Dr. Seuss) has a germanic roots meaning, to take hostage or to be a prison. Suppose in the future, social media will take hostage of our social identities where we become trapped in endless distractions preventing us from focusing on advancing our society.
